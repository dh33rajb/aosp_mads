aosp - This is to fetch and push (if need be) changes to the aosp source.
alt - This is to fetch and push changes to our project specific remote repository.

All our changes will be merged and pushed to this repo.

Branches:
---------

master - This branch will contain the final code changes pushed by each member of the team AFTER THE CHANGES HAVE BEEN TESTED and APPROVED.

per-person-local-branch (ex: cse622_fall15_mads for dheeraj) - This is a local branch that each one of the team member creates and pushes his changes before actually merging the changes to master.

So, in total at the least there will be 5 branches - 1 master and 4 local branches, 1 per team member.
